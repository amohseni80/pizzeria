# 🍕pizzeria

`Still in progress..⏳`


<h2>Pizzeria is a JavaFX application😎</h2>

This program asks the user to **sign in** to their account, and once they are in their account, they can **build** the pizza they prefer to. They'll also be able to view the **receipt** at the same time on the right side. If you would like to learn more about the **sign-in / sign-up program** and how it works, you can view its repository from [here](https://github.com/ashMohseni/sign-template). 


<h2>How does Pizzeria look like at the moment?🧐</h2>
So far the application looks like this👇<br><br>
