# 🍕pizzeria

`Still in progress..⏳`


<h2>Pizzeria is a JavaFX application😎</h2>

To be used by customers in pizza places for building any kind of pizza they prefer to!


<h2>Why Pizzeria could be useful? 🤷‍♂️ </h2>

- Less code is needed compared to other **GUI** frameworks.
	- Also that means **faster** speed !
- Responsive application design with flexible layouts.
- **JavaFX** provides a **rich** graphical user interface.


<h2>Is this all? ⁉️</h2>
<h4> Well NO!! Moreover I'm going to add more features to this app and make it more user-friendly👨‍💻</h4>

If at any point, you decided that you want to **help** and be a part of this project.

<h2>How does Pizzeria look like at the moment?🧐</h2>

<h2>So what is the goal?! 🌟</h2>
<h4>The goal for this app is to have multiple scenes with a more realistic design !! 🖥 </h4><br>
